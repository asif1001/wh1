Think like a Sr. developer and Build a **Web-Based App (WBA)** that is **installable as a PWA** on both desktop and mobile. The app should be **professional, modern, colorful, and very user-friendly**.

**Pages Required:**

1. **Login Page** – simple centered login card with company logo, email/password fields, and a primary login button.
2. **Home Page (Dashboard)** – card-based overview showing key metrics (tasks, shipments, complaints) and quick action buttons.
3. **Task Manager** – list of tasks with filters, status tags, and a floating ‘Add Task’ button.
4. **Shipment Monitor** – shipment tracking with table/cards, search bar, filters, and status color indicators (green = on time, red = delayed).
5. **Complaint Report** – submission form with fields (type, description, file upload) and a list view showing complaints with colored priority labels.

**Design Guidelines:**

* Use a **modern color palette**
* Card-based layout with rounded corners and shadows.
* Clear **button hierarchy** (primary, secondary, danger).
* Navigation: sidebar for desktop, bottom nav for mobile.
* Consistent typography and spacing for a professional feel.
* Must be **responsive** and **installable as a PWA** for desktop & mobile.”
